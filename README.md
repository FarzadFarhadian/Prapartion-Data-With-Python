# Prapartion-Data-With-Python
---

This project is a machine learning-based housing price predictor that uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict the price of a house based on its features. The project was developed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment and includes the following key stages:

1. Import Data: The housing dataset was imported into the Jupyter Notebook using Pandas, a powerful data manipulation library.

2. Clean Data: The dataset was cleaned to remove duplicates, missing values, and other inconsistencies using various Pandas functions.

3. Visualisation: The dataset was visualized to gain insights and identify patterns using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The dataset was analyzed to identify trends, relationships, and patterns using functions such as correlation matrices and scatter plots.

5. Model Building: The KNN algorithm was used to build a machine learning model based on the features of the housing dataset. The model was trained and tested using Scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library.

6. Model Evaluation: The performance of the KNN model was evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error, R-squared, and cross-validation score.

The code and files for this project can be found in the GitHub repository, which includes a Jupyter Notebook file detailing the data cleaning, visualisation, EDA, and model building stages. The notebook also includes detailed explanations and comments to guide users through the code.
